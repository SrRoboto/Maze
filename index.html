        <p class="text" id="p2">This is a building in the shape of a website ... a maze. Each numbered page depicts a room in the Maze. The doors in each room lead to other rooms. </p>
        <p class="text" id="p3">Your challenge is to find your way from room 1 (after the Prologue) to room 45 and then back to room 1 using the shortest possible path. If you use your head, you should be able to make the journey in only sixteen steps.</p>
        <p class="text" id="p4">There are a number of clues in drawings and in the story to help you choose the right door in each room. Clues in a series of rooms may relate to one another, and may indicate a path. Other clues may refer to a specific door in a single room.</p>
        <p class="text" id="p5">Anything on this site might be a clue.</p>
        <p class="text" id="p6">Not all clues are necessarily trustworthy.</p>
